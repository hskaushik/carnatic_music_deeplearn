# carnatic_music_deeplearn

Question: Can a machine can correctly identify Raagas from Carnatic music (South Indian Classical Music)?

I am trying to address this question using a database of personally curated music files and Deep Learning neural networks.

My work is based on the fantastic tutorial provided by [Nagesh Singh Chauhan](https://github.com/nageshsinghc4/Audio-Data-Analysis-Using-Deep-Learning/blob/master/audio_data_analysis_ANN.py).
